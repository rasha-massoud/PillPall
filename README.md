<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

###  PillPall is built using the following technologies:
- Employed [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), a powerful PHP framework for the backend of PillPall. Laravel provides a solid foundation for building secure and scalable backend systems. 
- Developed the frontend using [TypeScript with React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/typescript); this combination offers a more robust development experience by early error detection, and code maintainability.
- Leveraged the capabilities of [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/) to securely store and retrieve user data. 
- Integrated the [ChatGPT API](https://openai.com/) for the personal assistant screen to get helpful guidance and assistance.
- Combined the power of [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) with PillPall to create a more interactive and effective medication reminder system.
- Utilized the ["Open Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) font as the main app font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
- 🚨 Please note that the functionality to find nearby pharmacies is currently unavailable due to maintenance of the underlying [HERE API](https://developer.here.com/)
